        This is an atomic operation i.e. if one field can't be updated for whatever reason, none of them will be. 
        Associations will be created if they don't already exist, else they will be updated.
        `ID` is a valid field in the RequestBody, but shouldn't be changed and a `400 Bad Request` will returned if changing it is attempted.
